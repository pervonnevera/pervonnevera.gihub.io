        <h1>Project Details</h1>
        <p>The personal portfolio website project involved the design, development, and publication of a responsive website that was to showcase professional skills and achievements. Deployment was by GitHub Pages. Challenges included ensuring the site was fully responsive across devices, refining CSS media queries, and testing on various screen sizes. Also, the code needed to be clean and accessible to meet the best practices of web development. It has also integrated interconnected pages that make for smooth navigation, solved by introducing a user-friendly menu system and validating internal links. Thirdly, it needed proper optimization for better accessibility and performance; for this purpose, thorough testing was required using tools such as Lighthouse and making iterative improvements based on the feedback received. These solutions have given more functionality to the website, making it more user-friendly and at the same time applying important core principles of web development.</p>
